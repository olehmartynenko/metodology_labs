## Linked list
* [First implementation](https://github.com/olehmartynenko/metodology_labs/commit/15e807b987d910fbfce5dab7de551eb997f00c25) singly linked circular list.

* [Second implementation](https://github.com/olehmartynenko/metodology_labs/commit/84a96494830a0b432e6b926725643623fee1ad21) linked list based on build-in array class.

## Calculation of variant
Calculation variant: number of the gradebook % 4
```
1116 % 4 = 0
```

## Instruction
The project requires Python and Unittest to be installed on your machine.

Install unittest:
```bash
pip install unittest2
```

To run program:
```bash
~/metodology_labs/lab2$ python3 linked_list.py
```

To run tests:
```bash
~/metodology_labs/lab2$ python3 -m unittest test.py
```

## Conclusion
Tests saved my time when I was writing second implementation of list and it made me sure that I did it correctly. It was my first experience of writing tests and I liked it, so now I will use it more often.

I would say that tests are really important part for any project.
